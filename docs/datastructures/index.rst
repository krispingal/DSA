Data Structures
===============

This section provides an overview of the various data structures implemented in this library, along with insights into their importance and practical applications.

What are Data Structures?
=========================
At their core, data structures are ways to organize and manage data efficiently. Basic data types like ``int``, ``char``, ``float``, and ``boolean`` serve as the building blocks in most programming languages. However, real-world problems often require us to represent more complex entitiesâ€”such as books in a library, customers in a store, or nodes in a network. For these scenarios, we turn to **data structures**.

Many programming languages offer constructs like **structures** (which group related attributes) and **classes** (which can include both attributes and methods) to represent individual entities. However, when working with groups or collections of entities and performing operations on them, we need specialized data structures.

Why Learn Data Structures?
--------------------------
Understanding data structures allows us to:

1. Model real-world systems effectively.
2. Design solutions tailored to specific requirements.
3. Optimize performance for operations like search, insert, delete, and traversal.

Starting with the fundamental yet powerful **Array**, data structures expand to include:

- **Linked Lists**: Efficient for dynamic memory usage and insertion.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Crucial for hierarchical or networked data.
- **Heaps and Priority Queues**: Optimal for scheduling and resource allocation.
- **Probabilistic Data Structures**: Useful in scenarios like approximations or large-scale data processing.

A strong grasp of these concepts opens up a variety of tools and techniques, empowering you to choose the right structure for your problem.
