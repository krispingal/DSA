Algorithms
==========

Algorithms can be thought of as carefully designed recipes for solving specific problems. Like a recipe, if you follow the steps correctly, you should achieve the desired outcome. However, just as in cooking, there are situations where the outcome may not match expectations. Why might this happen?

1. **Ambiguity in steps**: Some instructions might leave room for interpretation, leading to variations.
2. **Substituted ingredients**: Missing components may lead to improvisation, which might not work as intended.
3. **Inappropriate inputs**: Even with the correct ingredients, the quality or context may not suit the recipe.

Similarly, in software engineering, simply implementing an algorithm might not always produce the desired results. The reasons could range from a mismatch between the problem and the algorithm to misunderstanding the algorithm's constraints and assumptions. This highlights the need to deeply understand not only how algorithms work but also when and where to apply them.

Why Learn Algorithms?
=====================
Understanding algorithms equips us to:

- Analyze problems more effectively.
- Choose or design the most suitable solutions.
- Optimize for performance, efficiency, or other constraints.

Structure
=========
Algorithms have been categorized by their purpose and functionality, allowing us to approach them systematically. The key categories include:

- **Math**: Algorithms rooted in mathematical principles, such as calculating Fibonacci numbers or finding prime numbers.
- **Sort**: Techniques for ordering collections, from basic approaches like Bubble Sort to efficient methods like Quick Sort.
- **Tree**: Traversal and manipulation of tree structures, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Each category is designed to help build an intuitive and practical understanding of its algorithms. As we progress, you'll gain insights into the theory and practical implementation of these approaches.
