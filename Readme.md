Data structures and algorithms
==============================

This repo hosts a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented 
to help me build a mental model on how these work under the hood.

## Data structures
1. Disjoint Sets Union
2. Linked list
3. Queue
4. Stack
5. Trie

## Algorithms
### Sort
1. Bubble sort
2. Merge sort
3. Quick sort (3 variants - Lomuto, Hoare, and Randomized)
