Data structures and algorithms
==============================

This repo hosts a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented 
to help me build a mental model on how these work under the hood.

## Data structures
1. Binary tree
2. Disjoint Sets Union
3. Doubly linked list
2. Heap (Max heap)
1. Linked list
2. Priority Queue (Max priority queue)
1. Queue
1. Stack (implemented using arrays and linked list)
1. Segment tree
1. Trie (implemented using arrays and linked list)

## Algorithms
1. Binary search
2. Prime sieve - sieve of eratosthenes
### Sort
1. Bubble sort
2. Merge sort
3. Quick sort (3 variants - Lomuto, Hoare, and Randomized)
